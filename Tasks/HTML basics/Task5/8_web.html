            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Chess is a strategic board game played between two opponents on
                an 8x8 grid known as a chessboard. Each player starts with 16
                pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two
                bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to
                checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is in a position
                to be captured ("in check") and there is no legal move to escape
                the threat. Here are some videos that teach how to play chess:
