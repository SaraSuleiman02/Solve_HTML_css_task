        <i>4 out of 5 stars.</i>
        <br><br>
        From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy names Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy anf his dog learning the true value of friendship sounds fimiliar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.

        This movie has everything you could ask for:

        <ul>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>A dog</li>
            <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
        </ul>

        While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.
