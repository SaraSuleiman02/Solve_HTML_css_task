                <mark>Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions,
                    called
                    programs,</mark> that computers can follow to perform tasks.
                It
                involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
                specifications of prosedures, by writing code in one or more
                programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level
                programming languages that are more easily intelligible to human
                than machine code. which is directly executed by central
                processing
                unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in
                several
                different subjects, including knowledge of the application
                domain,
                details of programming languages and generic code libraries,
                specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks
                accompanying and related to programming include analyzing
                requirements, testing, debugging (invistigating and fixing
                problems), <u>implementation of build systems, and management of
                    derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code.</u>
            </p>

            <p>
                While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term
                software development is used for this larger overall process -
                with
                the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for
                the
                writing and editing of code per se. <mark>Sometimes software
                    development is known as software engineering.</mark>
                especially
                when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design
                process.

                The first computer program is generally dated ro 1843, when
                mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a
                sequence pf Bernoulli numbers,intended to be carried out by
                Charles
                Babbage's Analytical Engine. However, Charles Babbage has
                already
                written his first program for the Analytical Engine in 1837.

                in the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing
                data
                into machine readable form. Later a control panel (plug board)
                added
                to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for
                different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment
                such as
                the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels
                similar
                way, as were the first electronic computers. Howeverm with the
                concept of stores- program computers introduced in 1949, both
                programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in
                computer memory.

                    Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies -- instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential electionsm or act as a personal trainer.
