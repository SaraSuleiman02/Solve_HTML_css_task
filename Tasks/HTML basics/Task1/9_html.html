        <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>

        <p>
            An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear
            Equations. The graph of it is a straight line.
            <br>
            For example, <br>
            <ul>
                <li> y = 8x - 2</li>
                <li>ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> - cx<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
            </ul>
            are some examples of a linear equation in two and three variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            Slope of intersection of two Linear Equations: <br>
            y<sub>1</sub> = mx + a and
            <br>
            y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub> + b
            <br>
            for the most points P(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and
            Q(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is: <br>
            <b>
                m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> -
                x<sub>1</sub>)
            </b>
